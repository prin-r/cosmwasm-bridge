# Cosmwasm-Bridge

This repo contain necessary components for retrieving the verified data from Bandchain.
The scenario here is that you have a contract called the consumer, which requires the data from Band's oracle.
You will need the five following components.
1. A datasource on Bandchain (See more details here ðŸ‘‰ [ds](/ds))
2. An oracle script on Bandchain (See more details here ðŸ‘‰ [os](/os))
3. Request & relayer service which is an off-chain part (See more details here ðŸ‘‰ [example_interaction_js](/example_interaction_js))
4. Bridge contract on Terra chain (See more details here ðŸ‘‰ [bridge](/bridge))
5. Consumer contract on Terra chain (See more details here ðŸ‘‰ [simple_consumer](/simple_consumer))

### This is the overall image that demonstrate the flow of retrieving the verified data from Bandchain and then save to the Consumer's state.
